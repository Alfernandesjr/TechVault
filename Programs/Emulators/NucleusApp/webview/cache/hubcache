Credit to them for their great work.\n\n[Split-screen setup guide](https://www.splitscreen.me/docs/usage). \n\nLet all instances load to the title screen before using inputs. If you are using at least one mouse and keyboard press the END key (default keybinding) to lock/unlock the input. Make sure to alt-tab to a non-game window before locking. \n\nThe host must use the Tiny Great Pot to create a session. At that point, the other players can join using the Effigy of Meleina. You should spawn in at a point nearby the host. Any player can leave at any time using the Separating Mist - If the host uses this item, the session will be disbanded and all players will disconnect. Make sure to complete the tutorial before attempting to connect the instances.\n\nTo use Mod Loader simply enable the launch option in Nucleus, as long as your mods are located in the original game folder's \"mods\" folder they should work. \n\nHandler by [PoundlandBacon](https://hub.splitscreen.me/user/AdiAjSyfZPMvu3a4M) and [Talos91](https://hub.splitscreen.me/user/eeL7HAz8zJovChWw4), special thanks to LukeYui, TechieW and Mr Goldberg.",

The game world is essentially composed of rough 3D objects—mainly cubes—that are arranged in a fixed grid pattern and represent different materials, such as dirt, stone, various ores, water, and tree trunks. While players can move freely across the world, objects and items can only be placed at fixed locations relative to the grid. Players can gather these material blocks and place them elsewhere, thus allowing for various constructions.",

      "description": "Zombies: Requires the steam version of the game, it's recommended you have the dlc too. Steam doesn't need to be running when you use the script. The game needs to be set to English language for the script to work. You can change this by right clicking the game in your steam library and selecting the properties menu, then selecting the Language tab. Select English from the dropdown menu and the required files will be downloaded.\n\nYour antivirus may delete files the script needs, if the script doesn't work this is the first thing to check. If you find it has deleted files you may need to remove and redownload the script.\n\nMake sure you press the END key, when all the instances have finished loading, to lock input. Press it again at any time to unlock input.\n\nWe included an option to let you change your settings for the first player, which will be copied to all other players. Alternatively you can change them in game per player. Not all changes will be made until the next launch of the game.\n\nThere are two ways to start a game:\n\n1) The first player starts searching for an online game (it will only find players connected to your local network) after around 7 seconds it will stop searching and start hosting instead, at this point the other players can join by searching the same game mode via the online menu. This mode fully simulates online, you can rank up/unlock as you would online.\n\n2) The first player creates a custom game and then uses the friends menu to send invites to the other players. For invites to work set your party to open.\n\nCredits/Thanks to The Project Nova Team for the LAN mod, and Pinecone from their forums for his invaluable advice!\n\nScript contributors: Rip3535, Pizzo and Zerofox.

      "description": "Multiplayer: Requires the steam version of the game, it's recommended you have the dlc too. Steam doesn't need to be running when you use the script. The game needs to be set to English language for the script to work. You can change this by right clicking the game in your steam library and selecting the properties menu, then selecting the Language tab. Select English from the dropdown menu and the required files will be downloaded.\n\nYour antivirus may delete files the script needs, if the script doesn't work this is the first thing to check. If you find it has deleted files you may need to remove and redownload the script.\n\nMake sure you press the END key, when all the instances have finished loading, to lock input. Press it again at any time to unlock input.\n\nWe included an option to let you change your settings for the first player, which will be copied to all other players. Alternatively you can change them in game per player. Not all changes will be made until the next launch of the game.\n\nThere are two ways to start a game:\n\n1) The first player starts searching for an online game (it will only find players connected to your local network) after around 7 seconds it will stop searching and start hosting instead, at this point the other players can join by searching the same game mode via the online menu. This mode fully simulates online, automatically populating the empty player slots with bots. You can also rank up/unlock as you would online.\n\n2) The first player creates a custom game and then uses the friends menu to send invites to the other players. For invites to work reliably make sure you set your party to open.\n\nCredits/Thanks to The Project Nova Team for the LAN mod, and Pinecone from their forums for his invaluable advice! \n\nScript contributors: Rip3535, Pizzo and Zerofox. \nAlso huge thanks to Talos, Dr.Oldboi and the rest of the SplitScreenDreams discord.",

Only working with latest legit Steam version of the game.\n\nThe instances will start fullscreen at first, this is normal. Log in using different Microsoft accounts in each instance, you can alt-tab between the instances if necessary. DO NOT press the prompt to start resizing the instances until all accounts are logged in. \n\nMake sure the Microsoft accounts are friends (you can do this via xbox.com), then in-game go to multiplayer in the settings and make sure hosting is turned on (its off by default). Once this is done, press start, and on the pause menu you'll see three empty player slots (little squares) just select one and you'll have the option to invite a friend, and should see the other account(s) available. \n\nEnable the option \"Keep Nucleus made user accounts\" in the Nucleus settings and save if you want to keep your login details, save games and graphics settings after closing Nucleus. \n\nIf the handler doesn't work or you get a game crash error try moving Nucleus to the root of the drive your games are installed on.

Special Ops and co-op are not supported for the time being.\n\nThe following is required:\n\n1. Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 game files in English (support will only be provided for the original Steam version).\n\n2. Nucleus v2.1.2 and above.\n\n3. IW4x raw files, current version 0.1.9 (the password to extract the files is 1234).\n- https://www.mediafire.com/file/awldn73rgs2zp22/iw4x_raw_files.rar/file\n\n4.

Once your instances have finished resizing and repositioning, press F2 or press and hold the START button on the first player's controller to connect to the dedicated LAN server. This will connect all your instances automatically. \n- If two or more instances are using mouse/keyboard, you will need to lock input by pressing the end key. Press the end key again to unlock the input. Please note that if the input is locked then F2/START button may not work so only lock input by pressing the end key once everyone is connected to the match. \n- Once your instances are in the match, you can quickly restart the match by simply pressing F3 or by pressing and holding the SELECT button on the first player's controller (keep in mind that F3/SELECT button may not work if the instances are locked). \n- Online play on IW4x servers also works, however you will need to select None under the select Mod option. \n- To play over LAN, the guest PC will need to select the last 1-3 digits of the Host PC's IP address and press F2 or press and hold the START button on the first player's controller once all the instances have finished positioning/resizing.\n\nIMPORTANT TO NOTE:\nThe exe files that I personally created with Autoit i.e. prompt1-3.exe, F3 restart.exe, start.exe, F2 guest.exe and F3 host.exe may be flagged by Windows Security as threats/viruses, so if this happens, no need to panic as they are none other than false/positives. However, as these files are essential for IW4x to work properly in NucleusCoop, you will need to restore the files and allow them under Windows Security, if not, Nucleus will just crash when you try to launch IW4x.\n\nCREDITS\n- X Labs dev team for making the IW4x modded client and for all their hard work, dedication and continued support.\n- SpecialK dev team for their amazing d3d wrapper.\n- PoundlandBacon and rip3535 for introducing me to Autoit and it's many neat features.",

It should join inside the server. When you are in, click 'ok' on the first Nucleus-Coop prompt (do not do it when the game is loading. You can just do it in the main menu or when you are in-game).\n\n4) When the player instance is ready and set (borders removed) you can start the next instance. A .bat file will automatically click the right instance for you.* Before starting the next instance launcher, edit the player appearance. I made a .bat file that will save each player document folder in the game script folder when you start the GTA Connected launcher. The next time, each player will have their own last exported player model.!!! GTA Connected 1.2.25 has a bug that doesn't let you save the player model, so at the moment this doesn't work !!! \n\n5) Repeat the process for each player but before starting the game, edit the player nickname inside the GTA Connected launcher!\n\n6) When all instances are ready, click ok on the last Nucleus-Coop prompt.\n\n\nNotes:\n- You can change the character appearance inside the lobby.\n- Press Win+B for split performance if needed.\n- If you can't hide the mouse pointer, press ctrl+t, hide it and press again ctrl+t.\n\nIf you want know more about NucleusCoop or you need support:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/nucleuscoop/comments/fjdqid/list_of_new_supported_games_and_faq/\n\nCredit: Grand Theft Auto Connected, Nucleuscoop and the Splitscreen Dreams discord.\n\nhttps://gtaconnected.com/\n\nhttps://github.com/ZeroFox5866/nucleuscoop\n\nSupport Grand Theft Auto Connected: https://www.patreon.com/jack9267\n\nDonate if you like the project: https://www.reddit.com/r/nucleuscoop/comments/e8y0i9/nucleuscoop_mod_v0982a_released/",

You can also use CTRL+Q to close Nucleus and all its instances when the input is unlocked.\n\nTo start a split-screen game, click \"Local Area Network\" on all instances. Then \"Create Game\" on one of the instances, choose the map you want to play and create game. Now the game should show up on the other instances, if it doesn't simply go back to main menu (click \"cancel\") and go back in. Join the game, depending on the map, you can choose game rules and teams. Once all instances have joined, start the game, and let the fun begin! :D\n\nIf you get a firewall popup asking for permission to communicate on the network, click END and CTRL+T , accept the prompt, then click END and CTRL+T again.

      "gameDescription": "Blending action and survival horror, Resident Evil 6 promises to be the dramatic horror experience of 2013. Resident Evil favorites Leon S. Kennedy, Chris Redfield and Ada Wong are joined by new characters, including Jake Muller, to face a new horror, the highly virulent C-virus, as the narrative moves between North America, the war-torn Eastern European state of Edonia and the Chinese city of Lanshiang.Starting with three distinct, yet interwoven story threads, each with their own pair of protagonists for either solo or co-op play, both offline and online, not only will Resident Evil 6 deliver both different perspectives and gameplay styles but, with the introduction of the innovative Crossover mechanic players will be able to team up and share the horror. At key moments during the game, up to four players can join together online to tackle a specific situation, with some stages seeing the usual partnerships swapped to further increase the depth of gameplay.Once players have completed the initial three campaigns they will unlock an all new campaign featuring Resident Evil’s very own femme fatale, Ada Wong. A single player experience, Ada’s campaign features unique missions, gameplay and weapons which will provide answers to the unanswered questions from the first three campaigns.",

      "description": "+ [Split-screen setup](https://www.splitscreen.me/docs/usage). Tested in latest legit Steam version of the game.\n\n+ This handler uses the Sekiro Online Multiplayer mod v2.05 by LukeYui: https://www.nexusmods.com/sekiro/mods/577 , no need to install it in your Steam game files, the handler includes it. All credit to LukeYui for its creation.\n\n+ Let all instances load to the title screen before pressing any inputs. Get pass the tutorial/first boss in all instances then press F1 in your keyboard and enable the online items, then one player (host) can use the Cursed Emblem item in the menu to create a co-op session. To co-op the host has to use the overlay (Shift+Tab) to invite other players, pause in all instances to use the cursor correctly in the overlay if it gets stuck. For invasion, other players can use the Vengeful Spirit item, no invite needed. If the host player dies it will need to create a new session and invite again. Rest at an idol before summoning other players for better results, restart Nucleus and run the handler again if the in-game enemies freeze or are unkillable. Disable any external overlays (like msi after burner or the nvidia overlay) if the invite overlay is not showing in the game when you press Shift+Tab in an instance.\n\n+ If you use keyboards/mice after all the instances have launched, resized and positioned correctly, press the END key once to lock the input for all instances to have their own working cursor, you need to left click each mouse to make the emulated cursors appear after locking the input. Press the END key again to unlock the input when you finish playing. You can also use CTRL+Q to close Nucleus and all its instances when the input is unlocked. You need to unlock the input to be able to use the invite overlay.\n\n+ Make sure you are using the vanilla game because a lot of mods are not compatible with the Sekiro Online Multiplayer mod. Install the SekiroOnlineFont file inside NucleusCo-op\\handlers\\Sekiro Shadows Die Twice\\ if you get weird text in-game. \n\n+ If you want to fix stretching in split-screen you need to create custom resolutions in your AMD/Nvidia/Intel panel (for example for a 1920x1080 monitor add resolutions like: 960x1080, 960x540, 1920x540 etc.) so the game can see and use them, this is also required for kb/m instances to work correctly. Alt-tab to the Nucleus app window to improve fps, reduce in-game graphics settings to improve performance. Lower your monitor scale % or set it to 100% if the custom resolution fix is not working for you.\n\n+ Read the [FAQ](https://www.splitscreen.me/docs/faq) if you have any further questions and want to know more about Nucleus Co-op. \n\n+ Handler by [Talos91](https://hub.splitscreen.me/user/eeL7HAz8zJovChWw4).

To remove black bars in split-screen in the RE Framework menu click on graphics and enable the aspect ratio fix, you can also change the FOV, keep in mind RE Framework has hud issues in ultra wide resolutions.\n\n+ Reduce graphics settings per instance to improve performance., you need good specs as this game can get quite demanding when running multiple instances, if the game runs too slow you will not be able to connect the instances too.\n\n+ Read the [FAQ](https://www.splitscreen.me/docs/faq) if you have any further questions and want to know more about Nucleus Co-op. \n\n+ Handler by [Talos91](https://hub.splitscreen.me/user/eeL7HAz8zJovChWw4).

      "description": "+ WARNING: Connecting the instances and starting a multiplayer game only works correctly in Windows 11, if you are on Windows 10 you will get stuck when the count reaches 0 after all players get ready in a lobby.\n\n+ [Split-screen setup guide](https://www.splitscreen.me/docs/usage). \n\n+ So the instances launch and resize correctly make sure you ran your main game at least once and changed some graphic settings. You can change the resolution in the game graphic options to adjust better to the window size if you get black bars. You need to add custom resolutions in your AMD/Nvidia/Intel panel (for example for a 1920x1080 monitor add resolutions like: 960x1080, 1920x600 etc.) for the game to see and use them. \n\n+ The online co-op missions and versus mode unlock after the fight against Raditz and after you beat the first offline parallel quest, host a lobby in one instance and join in the others using search game. \n\n+ If you want to use XV2PATCHER for mods you need to install it in your main files using the alternative dinput8.dll it includes and not the default xinput1_3.dll.\n\n+ If you want to use your own Steam save file, the file is located in C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\userdata\\\"your id\"\\454650\\remote\\DBXV21\\. But simply replacing the savedata bin file is not enough because this game ties your save data to your player steam id, so you need to get your player steam id number, [here is the easiest way to get it](https://support.ubi.com/en-GB/Faqs/000027522/Finding-your-Steam-ID?fallback=en_GB). Then you can paste your player steam id for the first player in Nucleus Co-op UI settings players tab and copy the save to its respective instance in C:\\Users\\<your username>\\NucleusCoop, you can access your saves per instance via the Nucleus Co-op UI after the handler first launch, right click the game icon and select open user profile save path in the UI.\n\n+ Read the [FAQ](https://www.splitscreen.me/docs/faq) if you have any further questions and want to know more about Nucleus Co-op. \n\n+ Handler by Zeuz3050 and [Talos91](https://hub.splitscreen.me/user/eeL7HAz8zJovChWw4).

If you are using the Steam version the above steps are not needed.\n\n+ 5) Go to network options, network mode and select LAN in each instance. If you are using the Steam version make sure you disable Steam Input for this game in Steam settings for the gamepads to work correctly. If you use keyboards and mice after all the instances open and finish setting up press the END key just once to lock the input for all the instances to have their own cursor and kb. Press the END key again to unlock the input when you finish playing. You can also use CTRL+Q to close Nucleus and all its instances when the input is unlocked. Limit the fps for better performance, you can also alt-tab to the Nucleus app window to even out fps, the game windows will still remain on top\n\n+ Notes: It is better for the first instance to be the host, so 2nd instance would connect to the 1st instance. Otherwise it is sometimes problematic to connect with the 2nd instance.\n\nAuthors and Contributors of this handler: Greenlamp and all the users from the Nucleus Co-op discord server that helped testing and provided feedback to improve this handler.",

This works fully offline so the game will not connect to the online servers, on first run if you accept the first EULA and reject the second it will not attempt to connect to the online servers and the main menu will start faster. \n\n+ This game can be quite demanding so reduce graphics settings to improve performance, make sure FidelityFX is set to off. \n\n+ Only one kb/mouse supported, if you use one after all the instances have launched, resized and positioned correctly, press the END key once to lock the input. You need to left click to make the emulated cursor appear after locking the input. Press the END key again to unlock the input when you finish playing. You can also use CTRL+Q to close Nucleus and all its instances when the input is unlocked.\n\n+ Read the [FAQ](https://www.splitscreen.me/docs/faq) if you have any further questions and want to know more about Nucleus Co-op. \n\n+ Handler by [PoundlandBacon](https://hub.splitscreen.me/user/AdiAjSyfZPMvu3a4M) and [Talos91](https://hub.splitscreen.me/user/eeL7HAz8zJovChWw4).

You must aid key scientists keen to defect to the US, and terminate those who would help the Russians. \n \n \n \nTake advantage of authentic weaponry, learn how to stalk your targets, fortify your position, set up the shot, use your skill, patience and cunning to achieve your mission. Stealth gameplay is the key as you find yourself trapped between two desperate armies in a race against time. Watch as the celebrated ‘bullet cam’ from Sniper Elite returns, bloodier and more gruesome than ever – skilful shots are rewarded with a slow-motion flight of the bullet, then targets are graphically rendered in X-Ray as the bullet enters and destroys your victim. Organs shred, bones splinter, teeth shatter, as the true impact of the sniper’s bullet is brought to life. \n \n \n \nAs World War Two ends and the Cold War begins, every shot counts.

The game already has native split-screen co-op for 2 players max but with this handler you can play up to 4 in missions that allow 4 players. \n\n+ To connect the instances select system-login in the main menu to enable the online play, then choose a mission, press Y and select recruit in one instance, once you are in the lobby after selecting a character the other instances can join by pressing Y too and selecting join. \n\n+ You can access each instance save in the app, after the first launch click game options/open user profile save path in the UI. You can even copy your main save to all instances there. Make sure all instances are in windowed and reduce in-game graphic settings to improve performance. \n\n+ Read the [FAQ](https://www.splitscreen.me/docs/faq) if you have any further questions and want to know more about Nucleus Co-op. \n\n+ Handler by [Talos91](https://hub.splitscreen.me/user/eeL7HAz8zJovChWw4).

Remember that SRMP is still in beta so weird things can happen.\n\n+ [Split-screen setup](https://www.splitscreen.me/docs/usage).\n\n+ Set your main game to windowed and in the correct custom resolution in the game options before running this for the instances to resize correctly. If you want the instances to resize correctly you need to create custom resolutions in your AMD/Nvidia/Intel panel (for example for a 1920x1080 monitor add custom resolutions like: 960x1080, 960x540, 1920x540 etc.) so the game can see them and you can select them in the game options. If the res does not match the window size the game will move the window to the center. You can also change the res in the game then use CTRL+R to reposition the instances. If your graphics panel does not support adding custom resolutions use the app [Custom Resolution Utility](https://www.monitortests.com/forum/Thread-Custom-Resolution-Utility-CRU).\n\n+ Start a game in one instance and host a game using the SRMP mod menu that appears when you press start/escape, in the main menu join to the host using the server code or the games in the same network option, alt-tab between instances to use the keyboard and mouse to connect, pause in all instances to use the cursor correctly otherwise it gets stuck, if you get a dlc mismatch error when joining just click on manage dlc in the main menu then try to join again. \n\n+ If you use a keyboard/m instance disable the gamepad input for that instance in the game options once you are in-game, make sure it is enabled for the gamepads instances. If you use keyboards/mice after all the instances have launched, resized and positioned correctly, press the END key once to lock the input for all instances to have their own cursor, you need to left click each mouse to make the emulated cursors appear after locking the input. Press the END key again to unlock the input when you finish playing.\n\n+ Read the [FAQ](https://www.splitscreen.me/docs/faq) if you have any further questions and want to know more.\n\n+ Handler by [Talos91](https://hub.splitscreen.me/user/eeL7HAz8zJovChWw4).

Take control of the hero, Conrad, the ship’s Chief Engineer, and continue your fight for survival across the fatally damaged space vessel, against a ruthless assault by an alien horde. Your only hope relies on reigniting the alien space craft’s monstrous engines to rescue you from impending annihilation. Deep inside the bowels of the unfamiliar craft, and with time rapidly running out, ready your weapons and begin to claw your way through the darkness in a fight for survival. But you are not alone. The ship is home to the carnivorous alien horde and something else ... something yet to reveal its true intentions ... something biding its time. In addition to the thrilling single-player campaign and all new “survivor” modes, the game also offers relentless, action-packed, two-player online co-operative battle modes.",

      "gameDescription": "Grim Dawn is an action role-playing game intended for digital distribution on the PC. It is being developed by veterans of Iron Lore entertainment, the makers of Titan Quest. Grim Dawn is being built with Crate's own improved version of the Iron Lore engine and toolset; the same technology used to create Titan Quest. As a spiritual successor, Grim Dawn will attempt to better perfect the magical formula of exploration, character advancement, and loot collection pioneered by Diablo. \n \nPlayers will be thrust into the dark, war-torn world of Cairn where a once proud empire has been brought to ruin and the human race driven to the edge of extinction. Cairn has become ground zero of an eternal war between two otherworldly powers, one seeking to use human bodies as a resource, the other intent upon destroying the human race before that can happen. This cataclysmic war has not only decimated human civilization but is warping the very fabric of reality and, in its wake, giving life to new horrors. \n \nFor humankind it is the dawn of a grim new age where iron has replaced gold as currency and the importance of salt as a weapon makes it far too valuable to waste on food. Small enclaves of human survivors exist scattered throughout the world, holed up in hidden refuges. These humans have quietly watched the warring invaders destroy one another and have become wise to the strengths and vulnerabilities of their otherworldly foes. A few survivors have begun to exhibit strange new abilities after surviving possession or exposure to the warp. These unnatural powers are feared by some but give many new hope of launching a resistance to fight the \"outsiders\" and reclaim what is left of their world. \n \nYou are one such individual. Blessed, or perhaps cursed, by the touch of Aetherial influence, you have powers and strength beyond that of normal men. It is now up to you to take this fearsome potential and use it against the enemies of humanity. Will you be the one to save Cairn from its grim fate? Or is humanity doomed to extinction?",

If you don't move your character for like 5 minutes you will be disconnected. You can still join again from the Net64 UI but if while disconnected other players take a star or do progress this will not probably synced with that instance. \n \nHow to:\n1. When you extract Net64, you have two folders. Client and emulator. Move the client folder inside the emulator folder.\n2. Run Nucleus, select the Project64.exe inside the emulator folder and start it.\n3. On Net64 UI edit the player name and character. Only the first instance need to start a server . \n4. On Project64, right click on the ROM, select \"Edit Cheat\", enable Widescreen. Save.\n5. Double click on the ROM name for run it and when the Super Mario 64 logo shows up, pause the ROM with F2 and select the emulator process on the Net64 UI.\n6. On Net64, go to the Servers tab and click on \"Connect to local server\". When you are in, minimize the Net64 UI, return to the emulator and unpause the ROM.\n7. Start the next instance. This time on Rom Cheats enable even \"No Music\".\n8. On Net64 [remember to edit the player name and character], after you select the right emulator, go to the \"Connect\" tab and use \"127.0.0.1\" as IP. When you are in, minimize the Net64 UI.\n9. Click ok on the last Nucleus prompt and play.\n\n- Xinput controllers must select \"Xinput\" when Nucleus ask. Buttons are already mapped.\n- DirectInput controllers must select \"DirectInput\" when Nucleus ask. You must map the \"controller 1\" tab for each instance [save the profile for next time].\n- Keyboards must pick even the mouse on Nucleus and map the \"controller 1\" tab for each instance that use it [you can press Default for quick keyboard map].\n\nIf you encounter any graphical issues or freezes when playing split with a romhack disable the cheats (at least for that part). \n\nThe Project64 cheat file included in the handler, contains the cheats Widescreen and NoMusic for these ROMs: \n-Super Mario 64\n-Odyssey 64\n-Sunshine 64\n-Super Mario 64 Land\n-Last Impact\n-Star Road\n-Battle Royale\n-Cursed Castles\n-Peach's Memory\n-Saphire\n-Star Revenge 3.5: Vacation of Cursed Dreams\n-Star Revenge 4.5: The Kedama Takeover Rewritten\n-Star Revenge 6.25: Luigi's Adventure DX\n-Super Mario Bros. 64\n-The Missing Stars\n-Ztar Attack Rebooted\n-Ztar Attack 2: A Blast to the Past",

The game has an enormous variety of long distance tracks: sand and snowy deserts, high-speed roads and impassable cross-country paths, African beaches and deserted Antarctic stations. \n \nThe game features 18 vehicles of different classes, from buggies to monstrous “Bigfoots”, as well as an additional prototype class. Rating points won in the races can be used to upgrade any of the vehicles, from a selection of 15 running gear, body or engine upgrade alternatives. Each vehicle is furnished with a detailed destruction system. Reaching the end of a course without suffering any losses is an enormous challenge that only a select few are able to accomplish. The opponents, who constantly create extreme situations, aren’t the only danger: players also need to watch out for railway crossings, heavy tanker trucks and even lightning in stormy weather.",

These are your rules.\nRemastered with enhanced graphics, Steelport the original city of sin, has never looked so good as it drowns in sex, drugs and guns.\nYears after taking Stilwater for their own, the Third Street Saints have evolved from street gang to household brand name, with Saints sneakers, Saints energy drinks and Johnny Gat bobblehead dolls all available at a store near you. The Saints are kings of Stilwater, but their celebrity status has not gone unnoticed. The Syndicate, a legendary criminal fraternity with pawns in play all over the globe, has turned its eye on the Saints and demands tribute.\nRefusing to kneel to the Syndicate, you take the fight to Steelport, a once-proud metropolis reduced to a struggling city of sin under Syndicate control. Take a tank skydiving, call in a satellite-targeted airstrike on a Mexican wrestling gang, and fight against a highly-trained military force by your lonesome in the most outlandish gameplay scenarios ever seen.\nWeapons of Crass Destruction – It’s one thing to defeat your enemies. It’s another to humiliate them. Hover jets, human cannonball cars and outrageous melee weapons are all part of the fun.\nCrazy Character Customisation – Create the most outlandish characters ever seen, from washed-up celebrities to maskless ninja pirates. Inside every sinner, there is a Saint. Who will you become?\nOver The Top Co-op – Fly solo or play online with a homie. Give freefall skydiving a try, landing in your partner’s flaming pickup as you make a desperate run toward a heavily armed Syndicate base. Steelport is always more fun with a friend.\nAll DLC included – All three expansion mission packs and 30 pieces of DLC from the original version.",

DO THIS OR IT WON'T WORK: \n\nMake sure you can launch and play this game fine from Steam before using this.\n\nOn Nucleus launch press the Windows key on your keyboard IMMEDIATELY before the first instance opens (Start Menu pops up, leave it on top). When all the other instances have opened, press the windows key again to close the start menu. You have to do this or the instances will not resize correctly.\n\nIn the Title Menu, go down to Party Settings and set ALL instances to System Link/LAN. Press Y in your gamepad to open that menu, if the instances do not see each other in the top right players menu set the instances back to online, accept then back to System Link/LAN until they see the other players. After the instances are connected, start a co-op campaign or multiplayer game.\n\nIf you want to fix stretching, you need to create custom resolutions in your AMD/Nvidia/Intel panel (this game only sees custom horizontal resolutions like 1920x600 and 3840x1080) so the game can see and use them.

      "gameName": "World in Conflict: Complete Edition",
      "gameDescription": "World in Conflict focuses on real-time tactics (RTT) gameplay, in a similar manner to Ground Control, a game also developed by Massive Entertainment, in which players deploy units onto a battlefield and must carefully make use of them to achieve victory, making use of support assets to further assist them. World in Conflict contains three factions: the United States, Soviet Union, and NATO. While players may only play as US and NATO forces during the single-player campaign, all three factions can be used in multiplayer games. \n \nDuring a game, players are given a pre-determined amount of reinforcement points, with which to purchase units with varying costs. Once the player deploys the units they purchase, they must wait 20 seconds for them to be airdropped to the field. If a unit is destroyed, the points are refunded to the player in order to allow them to bring in more units. During the single-player campaign, most missions vary what units the player can recruit, while some missions will offer the opportunity to recruit free units, though these cannot be replaced if destroyed. Each unit has strengths and weaknesses, such as mobile anti-air guns being most effective against enemy helicopters, and repair tanks being most effective at keeping vehicles and armor repaired. Each unit possesses a defensive ability, such as deploying smokescreens, while some units possess an offensive ability, such as marking targets for bombardment or using grenade launchers on enemy infantry. Once a unit's special ability(ies) has been spent, players must wait for them to recharge before they can be used again. \n \nIn addition to controlling units, players may also call in tactical aid by spending tactical aid points. Points are primarily earned from destroying enemy units in battle. Tactical Aids allow the player to call in anything, from airstrikes on enemy positions, the deployment of paratroopers, to launching carpet bombing raids and tactical nuclear strikes. Tactical aids can allow up to three deployments, after which the player must wait until the support has recharged. In the single-player campaign, players are restricted by what tactical aid they can use, which can change during a mission. \n \nThe game interface for World in Conflict has no framing in the game. A list of units occupies the bottom center, whereas the top right hand corner contains the expandable reinforcement procurement list. The mini map is in the bottom left hand corner, while the bottom right hand corner contains the special abilities buttons (including unit formation). Players can also use a messaging system that is designed to allow conversation between individuals regardless of whether they are on the same server or playing the same game. World in Conflict features a fully rotational 360 degree camera.",

Following the critically acclaimed releases of 2014's Wasteland 2 and 2015's Wasteland 2: Director's Cut, fans have been clamoring for a direct sequel. Now we can bring it to you, with your help! \n \nYou start the game as the sole survivor of Team November, a Ranger squad dispatched to the icy Colorado wastes. This is a land of buried secrets, lost technology, fearsome lunatics, and deadly factions. No one here has ever heard of the Desert Rangers. Your reputation is yours to build from scratch, and your choices may save this land or doom it. With a renewed focus on macro-reactivity, you’ll be picking between warring factions, deciding whether locations are destroyed or saved, and making other far reaching decisions that have a marked impact on the shape of your world. \n \n- A party-based role-playing game, with a renewed focus on our trademark complex story reactivity and strategic combat. \n- By including vehicles, environmental dangers, and a revamped, more fluid action system, we are evolving on Wasteland 2's deep tactical turn-based combat and unique encounter design. \n- Play by yourself or with a friend in story-driven synchronous or asynchronous multiplayer. Choices open up (or close off) mission opportunities, areas to explore, story arcs, and lots of other content. \n- Your Ranger Base is a core part of the experience. As you help the local people and establish a reputation in Colorado, quests and narrative will force you to make decisions on how to lead. \n- The game will be set in the savage lands of frozen Colorado, where survival is difficult and a happy outcome is never guaranteed. Players will face difficult moral choices and make sacrifices that will change the game world. \n- Wasteland 3 will feature a deep and engaging story utilizing a newly-revamped dialog tree system from the celebrated writers of Torment: Tides of Numenera. \n- Simultaneously releasing to Windows, Mac, Linux, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.",

Reduce graphics settings to improve performance.\n\nInformation about how the co-op works: \n\n\"Here's what you can co-op:\n\n-Story missions that actually take part in what the game calls \"battlefields\" which are initiated in very specific locations in the overworld. These are quite similar to how mission played out in the first DQH and other similar games. This is where there is a tricky bit that confuses people: only people that have already completed said mission in their own playthrough can join other people's.\n\n-Labyrinth missions which can be started from an NPC in town. These are rather short and sweet (and a little boring, can't imagine doing any of them a particularly high number of times) but anyone can join anyone else, with no restriction. These can also be completed solo with an AI party, if you so wish. In fact, the DLC party members (which aren't available in NA yet) can only be used in these missions. EDIT: And just to clarify, doing these missions is in no way necessary, nor are they tied to quests or anything story related. They are there only as an additional method of farming/grinding as well as to give a little more that can be co-oped, I guess.\n\nWhat this means is that for you and a buddy to co-op story missions, you both need to advance the story to where these missions take place and one of you has to complete it on his own. Not ideal. Also, and this is from hearsay, but additional Labyrinth missions only become available as you advance the story as well.\"\n\nAuthors and Contributors of this script: Talos91 from the Split Screen Dreams Discord.",

      "description": "Tested on The Elder Scrolls III Morrowind Game of the Year - Steam version.\n\nScript support multiple keyboards/mice and gamepads.\n\nReddit post : https://www.reddit.com/r/nucleuscoop/comments/p8de4i/the_elder_scrolls_iii_morrowind_pc_split_screen/\n\nPRE-REQUISITES:\n\nTES3MP: https://github.com/TES3MP/openmw-tes3mp/releases\n\nHow to:\n\n1. Start at least the game one time if it is a fresh install or you never open the game before (use the launcher to select the mods/expansions).\n2. Download and extract TES3MP. \n3. Start openmw-wizard.exe and set the game. Here is a quick guide that explains how to setup TES3MP: https://steamcommunity.com/groups/mwmulti/discussions/2/353915309331818721/#c359543542237902104\nAlso TES3MP F.A.Q. : https://steamcommunity.com/groups/mwmulti/discussions/1/353916184342480541/\n\n- Now the game should be ready for Nucleus-Coop. After you downloaded the script, select tes3mp.exe inside Nucleus-Coop.\n \n4. At the start, the game will ask you to make an account for the server (name[is gonna be the in-game name]  and password). Make it easy to remember or write it down for the next time you gonna play the game.\n5. When all instances are set and ready, click ok on the last prompt (if present) and press END.\n\nThe script has two modes: \n\n-'local-server' will start a dedicated server and make all the instances join in. Enable prompts if you need to create new profiles (be sure that the instance is fully set before starting the next one). When all instances are set press the 'END' key to restrict the input (press it again if you want to release it). By default, the password is 'nucleus'. You can edit the server password inside the script (.js file in the scripts folder). When you close the game, wait until the server saves for each player before closing the cmd window;\n\n-'server-browser' will launch the server browser to let you pick a server. This mode must use prompts (enabled by default). When you logged-in/created your profile and the player is ready to play, click 'ok' on the Nucleus-Coop prompt. Do the same things for each player. This mode will restrict the input from the start ( no need to press END). \n\nNotes:\n\n- Press F2 twice to hide the chat (better do it before the next instance starts for gamepads players). \n- If the cursor doesn't show up for the gamepad instances, try open/close the inventory multiple times and click some buttons.\n\nCredit: TES3MP, Nucleuscoop, Ilyaki, Talos91, and the SplitScreenDreams Discord server.\n\nhttps://github.com/TES3MP/openmw-tes3mp\n\nDonate if you like the project: https://www.reddit.com/r/nucleuscoop/comments/e8y0i9/nucleuscoop_mod_v0982a_released/",

Ten game modes - both team-based and \"every man for himself\" -- provide even the most hardcore gamer with palm-sweating challenges through unbelievably detailed indoor arenas and vast outdoor environments. As the ultimate techno-gladiator of the future, players will take their fates into their hands, battling against up to 32 other players online in action-packed, frag-filled arenas.\n\nAssault Mode - Assault mode returns! Redesigned for UT2004, this fan-favorite mode sees teams face-off to defend and attack fortified bases, from fast-moving trains, barreling across an arid alien desert to a Skaarj mother ship, poised to attack the human home world.\n\nOnslaught Mode - Onslaught mode takes team combat to the next level! Opposing teams are pitted against each other to capture and hold strategic points in order to attack and destroy the enemy power core. Taking place in massive outdoor environments, here is where vehicular combat comes into its own. Flying and driving machines take combatants to the frontline and gigantic mobile battle stations serve as a platform from which to launch devastating attacks.\n\nVehicles - Rev-up and ride out in an array of land-, air-, and space-based vehicles that play critical roles in a successful combat strategy in Assault and Onslaught. With vehicles ranging from single man fighters to five man behemoths, Unreal Tournament 2004 provides players with plenty of choices when shopping for a mechanized implement of destruction.\n\nLevels - More than 95 maps will be available immediately, including more than 45 brand new maps for all existing game play modes as well as new modes of play. Vast outdoor environments, deep space combat areas and tightly packed indoor techno-arenas are all waiting for the latest entrants to the Tournament.\n\nWeapons - The entire smorgasbord of frag-dealing weaponry from Unreal Tournament 2003 returns for the experienced player to wield masterfully against new contestants. Those armaments are joined by three new implements of doom: the Mine layer, which disperses spider-like bombs that chase and harass any enemy that comes within range; the anti vehicle rocket launcher, or AVRiL, which deals out a payload of massive rockets tuned to seek and destroy enemy mechanized units; the Grenade Launcher, which launches timed explosives that will bounce on the ground and stick to enemies and enemy vehicles, only to be triggered by the weapons altfire command; and, the return of the notorious Sniper Rifle from the original Unreal tournament, completely redesigned and upgraded to make heads roll.\n\nNew Characters - Unreal Tournament 2004 introduces 32 new characters on four new teams: The human Thunder Crash, lead by Tournament hero, Malcolm; the Robotic Corrupt, lead by an upgraded Xan Kriegor; the Iron Skull, a team of merciless Skaarj warriors; and the Hellions -- wreckless human mercenaries and pirates who delight in the thrill of the kill.\n\nNew Technology - Unreal Tournament not only brings new content for hardcore fans to relish, it also delivers a tremendous technology update over its predecessor, delivering a faster, slicker, deeper experience than ever before.",

Once you've finished playing, press the end key again to unlock the input.\n\n2.\tOnce the FFXIV launcher opens up, login with your Square Enix ID and press PLAY, only once the actual game instance appears proceed to press OK in the Nucleus prompt message - this will open the FFXIV Launcher once again, proceed to login with your second Square Enix ID and press PLAY. Once the second game instance appears, press OK in the Nucleus prompt window to initiate the repositioning and resizing process.\n\n3. Once you've finished playing, press CTRL+Q to quickly close your instances and to close Nucleus. In case you wish to view your desktop and minimize the instances without closing them, press CTRL+T.

      "gameName": "Star Wars: Republic Commando",
      "gameDescription": "Chaos has erupted throughout the galaxy. As a leader of an elite squad of Republic Commandos, your mission is to infiltrate, dominate, and ultimately, annihalate the enemy. Your squad will follow your orders and your lead, working together as a team-instinctively, intelligently, instantly. You are their leader. They are your weapon.\n\nStar Wars: Republic Commando is a tactical first-person shooter video game, set in the Star Wars universe. It was developed by LucasArts using the Unreal Engine, and published for the Xbox and Microsoft Windows in 2005. The game features both single-player and multiplayer game modes. In the story, set in the Star Wars Legends expanded universe, players assume the role of RC-1138 (\"Boss\"), an elite clone trooper, known as \"clone commando\", and the leader of the special ops unit Delta Squad, consisting of three fellow clone commandos with distinctive personalities and character traits: RC-1262 (\"Scorch\"), RC-1140 (\"Fixer\"), and RC-1207 (\"Sev\"). The story follows Delta Squad as they complete increasingly difficult missions throughout the Clone Wars and learn to bond as a team.\n\nRepublic Commando received generally favorable reviews at release. Many critics praised the story and combat, but criticized the short length and average multiplayer. In the years since its release, it has come to be considered one of the best Star Wars games ever made, and has gained a cult following.\n\nAn enhanced port of the game by Aspyr is set to release for the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 on April 6, 2021. As reported by Jordan Ramée of GameSpot, \"Handled by Aspyr Media, Star Wars: Republic Commando Remastered brings the original 2005 Xbox and PC game to PS4 and Switch with enhanced HD graphics and modernized controls, though the multiplayer is absent. Otherwise, it's the same game. And though the flaws in its gameplay are only more noticeable now 16 years later, this remaster manages to still deliver a compelling story of four specialized commandos engaging in a variety of combat missions across the Clone Wars.\".",

      "gameDescription": "Crab Champions is a solo developed game from the creator of Crab Rave. Each of the 3 main modes offer a different playstyle.\n\nSurvival (1-4 Players Co-Op PvE)\nFight your way through increasingly difficult islands that are populated with hostile enemies. Loot chests are scattered around each island containing upgrades that enhance different aspects of your crab's power. The in game economy makes it important to develop a strategy around when to buy chests as well as deciding on what upgrades fit best for your current build. The goal is to survive as long as possible before getting overrun by enemies. In addition to the main mode, test yourself with single island challenge runs and a bonus endless combo mini mode.\n\nRacing (1-4 Players)\nA complete change of pace from the Survival and Duel modes. No weapons, the only focus is on fluid, responsive movement. Playing solo or with friends, the goal is to make it through one of the race maps as quickly as possible to set a new personal record. Through trial and error, it's possible to find new ways to set records, combining chained movements like sliding and flipping.\n\nDuel (1-6 Players PvP)\nPlay with Steam friends (or bots if playing solo) in 1v1, 2v2 and 3v3 duels across small balanced maps. Skilled use of movement, timing and shields are required to come out on top in this fast paced mode. The first player or team to win 5 rounds wins the match. Custom games are also available, allowing players to choose their own rules.",

Feedback given to Codemasters was that players only played the game when they had a few hours to play. In response, Codemasters brought in this mode so that players could simply play for a short amount of time. In this mode the player will start as a team lower down the field, and over a ten race season the player will move teams mid-season, depending on their ability to beat rival drivers and objectives. \nCodemasters also introduced \"One-Shot Qualifying\", whereby a player has a single lap to qualify for the race. The three stage knock out session is still an option, however the single 20 minute session is no longer available in career mode. There is no longer an option to include all three practice sessions in a race weekend, but instead only a single hour session is available.",

From the director of CONTRA III: THE ALIEN WARS and CONTRA: HARD CORPS, Nobuya Nakazato instills more than 25 years of franchise pedigree into CONTRA: ROGUE CORPS with enormous crazed enemies, over-the-top violence, and a cast of diverse playable characters that add to the irreverent tone of the game. \n \nSeveral years after the events of the Alien Wars, CONTRA: ROGUE CORPS follows a former military group living on the fringes as bounty hunters and treasure finders in the Damned City. Survival requires fast reactions, powerful weapons and the occasional organ and cybernetic augmentation. Players will complete missions in PVE campaigns, gathering resources to upgrade their guns to stay alive in the Damned City. If all else fails… bring in a friend and mow-down enemies together in online and local multiplayer modes!",

      "gameName": "Fade to Silence",
      "gameDescription": "As the player you take the role of Ash, a natural but tormented leader. In that role you explore a post-apocalyptic, frozen wasteland to gather the resources necessary to establish a refuge for survival. With dwindling resources, simple tasks like upgrading equipment and collecting materials quickly require an expedition to scavenge the necessary items. In the search for survival materials, players must navigate a vast territory, in which they will encounter Eldritch monsters and an even greater foe: the unrelenting winter. While freezing temperatures constantly take their toll on the player Ash, the deadliest event is that of a blizzard. If caught by surprise, it takes every ounce of skill, determination and luck to survive. \n \nIn order to survive and overcome all challenges, the player needs to attract followers, bringing them into thei refuge. Each individual skillset and character traits grants access to higher tier resources and gear. Without such advances, the player character can scavenge only the barest necessities, crafting makeshift tools and weapons. \n \n“You’re glad to have found wood; for once, you’ll have a roaring fire in the camp. As your sled wolves race home, you pay no attention to the strange lights in the forest. You’ve done enough for today. \nThe wind suddenly picks up - a blizzard is moving in fast. The voice in your head dares you to keep going,”Come on! You have plenty of time to make it back.” You doubt it, but stopping now means you need to build a shelter—out of that precious wood. The snow begins to fall; you have only a moment to decide. Should you risk it and keep going, or do you play it safe but lose your firewood?” \n \nFade to Silence introduces the many dynamics of a harsh winter climate to a complex, character-driven, group survival experience. The dynamic weather system adds to the immersion of survival in a cold, corrupted world. Survival depends on how well the players read weather patterns, and if they come to the right conclusion - look for shelter or press home. The dynamic snow displacement leaves a realistic path by both player character and NPC. This telltale sign will tell you regions where it is good to hunt and regions where monsters are roaming.",

      "gameDescription": "\"When there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth.\" \n \nA tribute to the highly acclaimed film series in which the above quote originated from, No More Room in Hell (PC Gamer's Mod of the Year 2011, ModDB's Editor Choice Multiplayer Mod of the Year 2011), is a co-operative realistic first person survival horror modification for the Source Engine. Taking inspiration from George Romero's \"Of the Dead\" series, the mod is set during a time in which the world is on the verge of collapsing into chaos from a disease whose origin is unknown. Many experts and organizations have their theories and ideas on how such a disease emerged and started to systematically destroy our very way of life, but one fact is clear to all. Whoever perishes from the disease gets up and kills, and the people they killed get up and kill. \n \nThe chances of you surviving this all out war of society and the undead are slim to none. Already, there are millions of the walking dead shambling about, searching for food to eat. There's no known cure. One bite can possibly end it all for you. However, you aren't alone in this nightmare. There are still a handful of uninfected survivors left in this god forsaken hellhole, and with co-operation and teamwork, you may live long enough to fight your way to salvation.Features:Teamwork: Co-operative play with up to eight players. \n \nVoice and Text Communications Limited by Distance: The further you're away the harder it is for other players to hear you. Keep those walkie talkies close. \n \nDynamic Objective Maps: The next playthrough may not be the same as the last! \nSurvival Mode: Defend and maintain your shelter against the undead in the hopes of getting extracted to a safe area. \n \nA Realistic Approach: In short, no crosshairs with limited \"only when you want it\" HUD. In addition, ammo and weapons are extremely scarce. With that in mind, aim down your sights and shoot for the head! \n \nMultitude of Different Opponents: Ranging from the iconic \"walking zombie\" to the more contemporary \"runners\", NMRiH will keep you on your toes with a mix of dangerous foes to face down. However, the most dangerous enemy may not always be the walking dead... \n \nInfection: One bite may be what it takes to bring you down. If infected, you must decide if you want to alert your team to rid you of your burden, or to keep quiet in the hopes of finding a cure...",

      "gameDescription": "In Carmageddon, the player races a vehicle against a number of other computer controlled competitors in various settings, including city, mine and industrial areas. The player has a certain amount of time to complete each race, but more time may be gained by collecting bonuses, damaging the competitors' cars or by running over pedestrians.\n\nRaces are completed by either completing the course as one would a normal racing game, \"wasting\" (wrecking) all other race cars, or killing all pedestrians on the level.\n\nThe game was notable for its realistic and ground-breaking physics and for its in-game movie making features. It was also one of the earliest examples of sandbox 3D driving games, and may have influenced other later games including Driver and the Grand Theft Auto series.",

Just like before, the game has three courses – a Beginner course with 8 laps, an Advanced course with 4 laps, and a long Expert course with 2 laps. The 'time lap' mode also returns, and is accessed in the same manner – by holding down start at the transmission select screen. Like the original game, mirrored versions of the tracks can also be played by holding down the Start button when selecting the course. It is recommended, however, that the player has had mastery of the course beforehand. By request, an arcade operator could put the game on Grand Prix or Endurance mode to increase the number of laps in a game. Finishing a race in the top 3 in any course allows the player to view an \"ending\" and see the game credits.",

Covert espionage and infiltration? Or will you use propaganda to influence the citizens of the city and overthrow the controlling powers? \n \nThe world's governments are controlled by mega-corporations, democracy to the highest bidder. Society is structured for the benefit of those in power. The poor exist in the dark squalid underbelly of the city, while the wealthy swim in opulence and luxury on the upper tiers, and the vast middle-class are too comfortable with their lives of convenience to see the world for what it really is. Corporate police patrol the streets, brutally maintaining the status quo, all under the guise of keeping the people safe. The time for change is now, as a mysterious organisation rises from the slums of the city. They'll have to bribe, steal, hack, kill and augment their way through the barriers between them and their ultimate goal...but what are they trying to achieve? To free the masses from the corporate stranglehold, or to take control for themselves? That, is up to you.",

      "description": "### Guide\n***\n+ [Split-screen setup](https://www.splitscreen.me/docs/usage).\n\n+ IMPORTANT: On first run select the correct custom resolution in the game options-video options and click save in each instance otherwise they will resize again on their own after you click play in the game (if you have a 1920x1080 monitor for example select 1920x540 res in all for horizontal split-screen or 960x1080 for vertical). You need to create custom resolutions in your AMD/Nvidia/Intel panel (for example: 960x540, 1920x540 etc.) before running the game via Nucleus so the game can see and use them, set the correct custom res in-game for the instances to resize correctly and for the mice to work correctly.\n\n+ If your graphics panel does not support adding custom resolutions use the app [Custom Resolution Utility](https://www.monitortests.com/forum/Thread-Custom-Resolution-Utility-CRU).\n\n+ Select the We Need To Go Deeper process in the Nucleus process picker window after you set the correct custom resolution in an instance, click refresh if you do not see the game process. \n\n+ Only working with one gamepad as the first player/instance (because the game has very poor controller support and uses Unity horrible default input for controllers instead of xinput, connect only one gamepad) and multiple keyboards and mice. The game also does not have gamepad support in menus only during gameplay.\n\n+ If you use keyboards and mice after all the instances have launched, resized and positioned correctly, press the END key to lock the input for all instances to have their own cursor. You need to left click each mouse to make the emulated cursors appear after locking the input. Press the END key again to unlock the input when you finish playing. You can also use CTRL+Q to close Nucleus and all its instances when the input is unlocked. \n\n+ Create a LAN or Online game in the first instance and join in the others, LAN has a max 2 players cap in the same PC.

The city of weird science is in ruins, squabbling factions and criminals fight for power and a strange cult prophesizes the coming of “The end of times.” And they might be just right: A wave of uncanny events shakes the land, and it’s all connected to a mysterious creature, a former ally turned into a fearful arch-villain. Which means that Van Helsing will do what he does best: He wields weapons, prepares his deadly tricks, and hunts down the most dangerous monster who has ever lived… and this time it’s personal. He’s prepared to do anything to achieve his goal, even to face the darkest secret about the birth of the modern Borgovia.",

With a number of multiplayer modes and a compelling single player experience, Lost Planet 3 will delve deeper into the Lost Planet universe, uncovering hidden truths within the unique and dynamic environment of E.D.N. III.",

Navigate the menus using your main mouse cursor as the gamepads will control all the instances menus until you are in-game. \n\n+ This game uses the horrible Unity default input for gamepad support so if your gamepads do not restrict correctly do this: go to the game controls settings and map the gamepad you want to control that instance to the first gamepad mappings, for the other 3 gamepads unassign all the keys using the escape key in all instances. If you use keyboards/mice after all the instances have launched, resized and positioned correctly, press the END key once to lock the input for all instances to have their own cursor, you need to left click each mouse to make the emulated cursors appear after locking the input.

It is a 3D platformer developed by a group called Sonic Team Junior, using a modified version of the Doom Legacy source port of Doom, to allow for such things as optional analog control and true room-over-room (something not possible in the standard Doom engine), as well as the standard gameplay elements Sonic games are known for. It has been in the works since 1998 and is currently nearing completion, though several parts of the game are still missing. \n \nSonic Robo Blast 2 is closely inspired by the original 2D Sonic games for the Genesis and attempts to recreate a game with this style in 3D, though it also borrows elements from the current Sonic games, such as Sonic's signature Air Spin Attack. Entirely original to SRB2 is its Multiplayer mode, a variation of classic first-person shooter games with Sonic elements. Due to being built with a modified Doom Legacy engine, the game is also very easily customizable. Custom levels, characters and even source code modifications can be created with the help of external editors.",

It includes every robot master as a playable skin, over 50 weapons and maps based off the original games, 32 player online play, a singleplayer botmatch campaign and much much more. If you’re a fan of online first person shooters or Mega Man, you simply have no excuse to not download and give Mega Man 8-bit Deathmatch a try today! \n \nThe game can be played in pretty much any game mode in Zandronum, but will be designed for Deathmatch. To keep the gameplay balanced and simple, you will have to find weapons scattered around the map and pick them up like in standard Doom fashion. Along with the huge amount of weapons, there are special inventory items which can be used at any time, such as the Rush Coil and E-Tank. The aim of the game is to destroy the enemy players and earn the most kills, known more commonly as “frags”. \n \nSupported gameplay modes include: \n \n  Deathmatch \n  Team Deathmatch \n  Last Man Standing (Randomly selected weapons) \n  Team Last Man Standing \n  Possession \n  Team Possession \n  Capture The Flag \n  One Flag CTF \n  Terminator \n  Duel \n  Instagib (All robots fire instant killing Metal Blades) \n \nThe game also has a single player campaign that is split into chapters, based on each Mega Man game. Each chapter takes you through all the standard maps with a predefined bot set up and boss battles. Between chapters you return to Dr. Light’s lab, where you can practice with weapons etc.",

The script doesn't store the game files, so you don't need to delete the Nucleus content folder of the game. \n\n1) If you or at least one of the players, didn't login already, a cmd window will appear. Follow the instructions. \n*The important is that you do it at least before starting the next instance.\n\n2) Before starting the next instance, go in the control's options and load the \"Gamepad.blk\" or \"Keyboard.blk\" depending on the player input. You can find it at the root of the instance folder.\n*It seems that the gamepad UI is also stored in the registry lines. The very first time should be automatically enabled/disabled, while if you will change the input on the next session, you will need to switch to it manually.\n\n3) When all instances are set, press ok on the last Nucleus-Coop prompt (hook/send fake message) and press the 'END' key to restrict the input (this is also needed for gamepads). \n\n4) Here, you can add other players as friends and in the same platoon. \n\nNotes:\n- Anti-cheat is disabled (is a game feature). You will be able to play on casual matches or custom ones but not modes that requires it (like competitives).\n- You can find the input presets inside Nucleus-Coop\\scripts\\WarThunder\\Presets. Read the Read-Me.txt if you want to edit the input. \n- Gamepads has full support in this game. So you can still use the game menu even after all is set (better if you enable the gamepad UI).\n\nIf you want know more about Nucleus-Coop:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/nucleuscoop/comments/fjdqid/list_of_new_supported_games_and_faq/\n\nCredit: Nucleuscoop and the Splitscreen Dreams discord.\nhttps://github.com/ZeroFox5866/nucleuscoop\n\nDonate if you like the project: https://www.reddit.com/r/nucleuscoop/comments/e8y0i9/nucleuscoop_mod_v0982a_released/",

Should you try that unknown potion? Maybe it's Healing? What about that wand? Maybe it's Magic Missile... or maybe it's a Wand of Create Monster, and it'll get even stickier!\n\nYou start with your choice from 16 character classes, each with different starting equipment, stats, belief system, and available talents. The game you play also depends very much on what interesting loot you find.

Very quickly, you discover the remnants of an older civilization. That civilization called themselves the Endless, among their ruins, a matter called Dust with amazing proprieties is found. It shapes into whatever its user thinks of, it gives a reality to dreams… dreams that lead to the extinction of the Endless.\n\nSince then that matter became the most precious matter of the universe, and therefore the universal currency… but in front of the power of the Dust it is hard, even for the purest beings, not to fall under its charm…\n\nWe want the players to live an experience that goes beyond just strategy. You will live your own story of space conquest, with your own randomly generated galaxy full of civilizations, lifeforms, technologies and unknown worlds for you to conquer.",
